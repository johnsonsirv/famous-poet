### MVP Sprint Challenge 

### Timezone: West African Time / Lagos

##### Idea: Famous Poet
##### Naive Description / Pitch:
As we grow and give birth to children in this jet age, some traditional cultures become obsolete. We often forget old poems, proverbs and songs that our parents and ancestors used to know. 
The **Famous Poet** is an ancient poet who was with our forefathers in their time. It understood their languages and remembers all the poems they recited as they grew up. 
The **Famous Poet** also lives with us in this present age and will be with our children in years to come.

The **Famous Poet** speaks many languages.

Visit the **Famous Poet** home and listen as it recites poems you will love. If you like the **Famous Poet**, then teach it your language.

**Objective:** Build a crowdsourcing app that will help us transfer down tradition through poems and songs. The app will store collections of history poems, songs across several languages. Because the WWW never really dies, the next generation will also find this app useful as it could serve as a base for future development or innovation.

### ROUND 2 will commence in 1 week time
